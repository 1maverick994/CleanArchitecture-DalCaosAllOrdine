## Why Clean Architecture? 🤔

Have you ever found yourself:
- Drowning in a sea of spaghetti code? 🍝  
- Wondering why small changes require monumental effort? 🏗️  
- Dreaming of a project that doesn’t break at the slightest touch? 💭  

Then this is for you! Clean Architecture is more than just a buzzword; it’s a way to structure your software so that it remains resilient, adaptable, and easy to understand—even when your future self (or your teammates) revisit the code.
